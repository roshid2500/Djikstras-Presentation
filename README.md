# Djikstras-Presentation
CS375 Presentation 

There's a separate README for Dijkstra's Algorithm in the "presentation" directory

To use graphgen, first do "make"
Then run the program on this command:

./graphgen complete/incomplete directed/undirected #ofnodes max#ofedges maxdistance outputfilename

Complete/Incomplete: Do "complete" if you want a complete graph, else anything is fine except for a blank.
Directed/Undirected: Do "directed" if you want a directed graph, else do "undirected"
#ofnodes: number to represent the number of nodes. Can't be 0
max#ofedges: number to represent max number of edges. Can't be 0 or more than or equal to #ofnodes
maxdistance: number to represent max distance
outputfilename: example would be "output.txt"
